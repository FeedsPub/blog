In most cases, you can create an RSS feed by adding ".rss" to the end of an existing reddit URL:

- Front page: http://www.reddit.com/.rss
- A subreddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/news/.rss
- A user: http://www.reddit.com/user/alienth/.rss
- A multireddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/news+wtf.rss (note that the slash is optional).
- The comments on a specific reddit post: http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1uc9ro/wearing_a_mind_controlled_exoskeleton_a_paralyzed/.rss
- Submissions from a domain: http://www.reddit.com/domain/microsoft.com/.rss
