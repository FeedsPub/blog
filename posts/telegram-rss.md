Telegram don't offer RSS officially, but still there are some ways to generate it. We will introduce a simple way here.

## With [RSSHub](https://rsshub.app)

### 1 Get the name of a public channel

### 2 Replace `[channel]` in the following URL

https://rsshub.app/telegram/channel/[channel]

For example, the feed URL of `durov`(founder of telegram) is:

https://rsshub.app/telegram/channel/durov
