title: Introducing Feeds Pub

[Feeds Pub](https://feeds.pub) is an RSS reader and network.

It starts from two simple needs of myself:

1. I want to know what feeds my friends are following.
2. I want to know who is following my blog.

None of the current RSS readers have these features. And I think other people might also have these needs.

So after spending about 3 months in designing and coding, Feeds Pub is hereðŸŽ‰

The ultimate goal of Feeds Pub is to improve people's reading experience. Make it easier to find good stuff to read and follow.
