        <p><a href="https://feeds.pub">Feeds Pub</a> is an RSS reader and network.</p>
<p>It starts from two simple needs of myself:</p>
<ol>
<li>I want to know what feeds my friends are following.</li>
<li>I want to know who is following my blog.</li>
</ol>
<p>None of the current RSS readers have these features. And I think other people might also have these needs.</p>
<p>So after spending about 3 month in designing and coding, Feeds Pub is hereðŸŽ‰</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of Feeds Pub is to improve people's reading experience. Make it easier to find good feed to read and follow.</p>
